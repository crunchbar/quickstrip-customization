      You can change all of the function buttons on the QuickStrip (and the MORE Panel) as you prefer.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Look through the list of features in the "All Choices List" - and check all that you might be interested in.
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you check items in the "All Choices List" they will show up within "My Choices" so they are handy for exploring and putting into your QuickStrip or More Panel.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can then drag buttons back and forth between My Choices and the QuickStrip (or the MORE Panel) till you get what you want there.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The strip will automatically make room and resize for any number of buttons you want to add.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also resize the QuickStrip yourself using the + and - buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you are done - click SAVE.
        </li>
      </ol>
      NOTE: Everything can also be done by those who cannot "drag and drop" by using the left- and right-click buttons on the mouse/touch screen. Everything can also be done using the keyboard only, by using arrow key, tab, spacebar and return keys. Â
